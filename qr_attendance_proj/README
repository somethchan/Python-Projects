How the script works:

1. Using uvicorn to listen for incoming HTTP requests
uvicorn app:app --host <mail_server_ip> --port <listen_port> --workers <num_connections>

The middleware code intercepts the http process and checks if the requestor IP is part of a permitted IP list in `http_listener.py`.
If the IP is among the list of permitted IPs, the middle triggers blocking code or sequentially executed code. Therefore, the number of workers defined for `--workers` correlates to the number of concurrent sessions are available.
